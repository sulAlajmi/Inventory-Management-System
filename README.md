Inventory Management - Observer Pattern

Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the Observer Pattern used in the context of inventory management. It simulates how different systems (observers) are notified when there are updates in the inventory, such as low stock notifications for the admin, customer notifications when a product is back in stock, and sales report updates.

The project is created for the Software Instructions course as part of applying the Observer pattern in a real-world scenario.
